! SCCS_data: @(#) Form 1.1 92/12/02 14:47:12
!
! Note that if children of the form are created in a upper left
! to lower right order, as specified by the order of the children
! in the form's wcChildren resource, then one can set the fromHoriz
! and fromVert constraints on the children as shown here.  
!
! If you cannot guarantee this ordering of creation, then you should set
! the constraints in the wcAfterChildren callback of the form widget.
! Since this callback is invoked after the children are created but
! before the children are managed, the form does not first lay out the
! children, and then gets hit with a request to change everything:
! form (like any reasonable composite widget) computes the layout
! of children in its change_managed method, hence the layout calculations
! are performed after the constraints are set using either approach.

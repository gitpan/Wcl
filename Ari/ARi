! This file gets installed into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults and is
! the default resource file loaded when Ari is started.  If the user
! does not provide a -rf command line option specifiying a user supplied
! resource file, then Ari loads its Demo resources which provides a
! simple interface for trying out all of the Ari examples in
! /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Ari
!
! NOTE: Nothing but this single WclInitResFile specification should be here!
!       This resource is set only by the command line arg -rf

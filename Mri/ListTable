!  Scrolled Lists in XmpTables
!  ------------------------
!
!  This resource file presents the way one must deal with scrolled lists
!  which are managed by XmpTable widgets.  In the layout resource for the
!  XmpTable widget, we must name the scrolled window, NOT the list:
!
!        *table.layout:          quit    0 0 1 1 h ;\
!                                slistSW 0 1 1 1
!
!  If we simply said "slist" instead of "slistSW" then nothing
!  appears, because slist is not one of the children of table.
!  Rather, slistSW is the child of table, and slist is the
!  child of slistSW.
!
!  As an aside, the layout option h on the quit button allow
!  resizing to work nicely.  Compare the behavior of the XmpTable
!  with the resize behavior of XmRowColumn.  I think you will
!  prefer XmpTable over XmRowColumn.

!
! This file gets installed into /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults and is
! the default resource file loaded when Mri is started.  If the user
! does not provide a -rf command line option specifiying a user supplied
! resource file, then Mri loads its Demo resources which provides a
! simple interface for trying out all of the Mri examples in
! /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Mri
!
! NOTE: Nothing but this single WclInitResFile specification should be here!
! NOTE: Normal resource files should NOT use wclInitResFile resource.  This
!       resource is set by the -rf command line option.  By using it here,
!       I can cause the Demo file to be loaded ONLY when there is no -rf
!	given on the command line.
